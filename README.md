# Student-Information-Application
This project is an application about holding student information.

You will create a Student class to hold the student information which will have name, surname and ID as variables.

When creating the MasterStudent or PhdStudent objects, you should ask for the
necessary information for each class. For example, to create a MasterStudent, you should
ask name, surname, id, thesisName. To create a PhdStudent, you should ask name,
surname, ID, thesisName, and lectureHours.

When using the 4th option, you should shuffle the student list so that each time the students
are printed in different order. You should use a ListIterator to move through the student
list.

When using the 5th option, the program shows the number of created student objects.

When using the 6th option, you should ask for the student ID, and you should search the
student list by checking the ID of the student using a ListIterator one by one. When the
student with the given ID is found, you should remove it from the list.

When using the 7th option, you should create a personnel using their name and surname.

When using the 8th option, you should iterate over the ArrayList<Cafeteria> and call the
serveFood() methods of each object.
